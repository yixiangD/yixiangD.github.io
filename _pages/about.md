<!--- Please consider to submit to our special issue on *Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics*: [Physics-informed machine learning for biomechanics and bio-fluid dynamics](https://www.techscience.com/mcb/special_detail/physics_machine-learning). The deadline is **May 31, 2024**.-->
- I am currently an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.cis.udel.edu/) at the University of Delaware.
- My full-length can be found [here](http://yixiangd.github.io/files/YixiangDeng_CV.pdf).
- **For more information about my current research, please visit my lab webpage**: [Computational Intelligence for Dynamical Systems Laboratory](https://ydeng-group.github.io/).
- Before joining UD, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Prof. Daniel Lingwood](https://ragoninstitute.org/lingwood/) at [Ragon Institute of Mass General, MIT, and Harvard](https://ragoninstitute.org/) from 2022 to 2024. In the meantime, I also worked with [Prof. Douglas A Lauffenburger](http://web.mit.edu/dallab/people/index.html) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). I was co-advised by Prof. Lauffenburger and [Prof. Galit Alter](https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3588853/Galit-Alter) (now the Vice President of Immunology Research at Moderna) before October 2022.
- Before joining the Ragon Institute, I completed my Ph.D. study at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis) in 2021. I received my B.Eng. degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2015.
